# Joining A Telegram Token Permission Group

To leverage the Collab.Land bot, you will be asked to connect your wallet to the bot so it may verify you are the wallet owner.

For best results, make sure you are on your Telegram desktop app to complete these steps and you have already downloaded and setup MetaMask.
 
Joining starts with an invitation link from the bot. Communities generally post the link in a public group or website.

**Example Link:** https://telegram.me/collablandbot?start=ABCD1234...
1. After following the link you will receive a DM from the bot with a **Start** button at the bottom.
2. Select the **Start** button
3. Select **Connect** button.
